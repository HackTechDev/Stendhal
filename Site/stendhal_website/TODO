* Remove Tables from webpage and use CSS (only a few missing)
* Clean HTML code a bit, some parts can render in a simpler way.
* Movies should be handled from database.
* Refactor Events, Screenshots and movies as the database handling code is almost equal.
* The Top Menu is failing for IE 6 and 7.
* Automate creation of world map and split scaled up parts of the world map.
  * Alternatively develop using Google earth or similar something to browse the world map.
